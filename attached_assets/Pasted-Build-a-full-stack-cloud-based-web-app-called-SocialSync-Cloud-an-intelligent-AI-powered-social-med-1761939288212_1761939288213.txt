Build a full-stack cloud-based web app called SocialSync Cloud, an intelligent AI-powered social media content scheduler and trend analyzer. The app should help users plan, analyze, and optimize their posts using AI insights.

🎯 Project Summary
The platform allows users to:
* Write and schedule social media posts in advance.
* Get AI-generated hashtags and sentiment insights for each post using the Hugging Face API.
* View analytics and engagement predictions for better posting times.
* Store all posts and schedules securely on Google Firestore (Firebase).
* Authenticate using Firebase Auth (Email + Google Login).
* Be hosted entirely on Firebase + Vercel (cloud deployment).

🧠 Core Features
1️⃣ User Authentication
* Firebase Authentication (Email/Password + Google Sign-In).
* {user choose among  login and register }
* On login, users are redirected to their personal dashboard.
* Store basic user profile data in Firestore.
2️⃣ AI Content Assistant (via Hugging Face API)
* On the “Create Post” page, users can type or paste their content idea.
* A button “✨ Analyze & Generate Hashtags” triggers an API call to Hugging Face sentiment-analysis model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english).
* The app should analyze text sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) and recommend hashtags automatically (like #AI #Motivation etc.).
* Display results beautifully with colored sentiment badges and animated hashtag chips.
3️⃣ Post Scheduler (Firestore Integration)
* After AI analysis, the user can select a date and time for posting.
* When clicking “Save Post”, the data (post text, hashtags, sentiment, date/time, user ID) is stored in Firestore.
* A “My Posts” section lists all scheduled posts with edit/delete options.
* Show remaining time until scheduled posting (e.g., “Posts in 2 hours”).
4️⃣ Analytics Dashboard
* Add a modern, colorful analytics section (use Chart.js or Recharts).
* Display graphs for:
    * Number of posts per week
    * Sentiment distribution (positive/neutral/negative)
    * Best posting times (based on frequency)
* Include cards with metrics like “Total Posts”, “Top Hashtag”, “Positive Rate”.
5️⃣ Cloud Deployment & Backend
* Store all post data in Firestore (Firebase).
* All API calls for Hugging Face should be handled via backend routes (Node.js API folder or Firebase Cloud Function).
* Prepare the app for Firebase Hosting or Vercel deployment.

🎨 Frontend Design & Aesthetic
* Framework: React (Next.js or Vite)
* Theme: Modern, vibrant, creative social dashboard
* Use a colorful palette with soft gradients and animations.
* Include a sidebar navigation with icons for:
    * 🏠 Dashboard
    * 🧠 AI Post Assistant
    * 📅 Scheduler
    * 📊 Analytics
    * ⚙️ Settings
* Dashboard should greet user (“Welcome back, [Name]”) with an AI-themed hero section and colorful cards showing quick stats.
* Use animated transitions (Framer Motion or simple fade/slide effects).
* Make sure the layout is responsive and mobile-friendly.

🧩 Tech Stack
* Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (clean and colorful)
* Backend: Node.js (API routes or Firebase Cloud Functions)
* Database: Firestore (Firebase)
* Auth: Firebase Auth
* AI API: Hugging Face Sentiment + Hashtag Generator (custom logic)
* Analytics: Chart.js or Recharts
* Deployment: Vercel / Firebase Hosting (cloud)

🧠 Additional Enhancements
* Add toast notifications on actions (post saved, deleted, etc.)
* Display a loader animation while waiting for AI results.
* Include light/dark theme toggle for better UI polish.
* Optionally, simulate “post engagement” (likes/comments) data in analytics using dummy Firestore fields to make graphs look more realistic.

📦 Expected Output
* A beautiful, cloud-ready full-stack web app with:
    * Authenticated user dashboard
    * AI-assisted post creation
    * Firestore integration
    * Visual analytics
    * Cloud deployment-ready setup (Firebase config + .env placeholders)
The goal is to make it feel like a real SaaS platform, but easy to demo in a college cloud computing project environment.
